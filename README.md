This webapp (eventually) will build virtual machines on most hypervisors(the most important currently).

The webapp will focus on vmware and redhat and expand from there.  The app is very ugly in its current state and non-functioning, but
keep checking back as I am going to focus more on it in the coming weeks.


To install on a linux system run the following:

gem install bundler

inside the directory run:

bundle install

To run the app after the above has been ran:

ruby vm_me.rb
